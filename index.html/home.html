<h4>OUR CRECHE AND NURSERY SECTION</h4>
<p>The creche and nursery level in education is a unique one.Children at this stage tend to have phobia for school,some even cry when they are being dropped off because of being too attached to their  homes.At Great Elite Academy,this phobia is overcomed by the friendly environment created to make the school become a home away from home.It is also of no doubt that to have a soild primary section,the work starts at the nursery.Therefore in our nursery section,the children are made to learn to read,write,calaculate and analyze properly before moving on to primary.This is achieved through the relentless effort of the management in providing the learning aids as well as experienced and well trained staff to make learning fun and easy at this level.</p>
</div>
<div id="school-sections">
    <h4>OUR PRIMARY SECTION</h4>
    <P>We have observed that children at this stage are often outspoken and desire to explore and create things.A lot of meaningful activities are needed in which this curiosity,vitality and creativity can be exerted.In Great Elite Academy,we help our kids at this section to channel these inherited traits to a learning advantage by providing activities and facilities for optimum performance.</P>
    <p>Our Pupils at this stage are engaged to explore ideas,analyze details and make constructive suggestions to issues.Our pupils at this stage are also made to do some domestic works in school as well as exposed to projects,presentations(group and individual),debates and exhibitions.This is done to boost their confidence as well as to prepare them for the ever challenging and changing world.</p>
    <p>Our academic prowess at this level can be seen at our results and performance in various external examinations and competitions.</p>
